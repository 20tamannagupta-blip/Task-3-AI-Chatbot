#DESCRIPTION:
The task of an NLP Chatbot project is to design and develop a system that can communicate with users using natural human language. The chatbot should be able to understand user input, process the text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, and generate meaningful and relevant responses.

The first task is **data collection**. This involves gathering sample conversations, frequently asked questions (FAQs), or predefined question–answer pairs that the chatbot will use for training. The quality of data plays an important role in how well the chatbot performs.

The next task is **text preprocessing**. In this step, the user’s input text is cleaned and prepared for analysis. This includes converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation and special characters, tokenization (breaking sentences into words), and removing stop words like “is”, “the”, and “and”. Stemming or lemmatization may also be applied to reduce words to their base form.

Another important task is **intent recognition**. The chatbot identifies the user’s intention, such as asking a question, requesting help, or greeting. This is done using NLP techniques or machine learning models that classify the input text into predefined categories (intents).

The chatbot also performs **entity recognition**, where it identifies important information from the user’s input, such as names, dates, locations, or products. This helps the chatbot give more accurate and personalized responses.

After understanding the input, the chatbot moves to the **response generation** task. Based on the recognized intent and entities, the system selects or generates an appropriate response. This can be done using rule-based methods, predefined answers, or machine learning models.

The next task is **conversation management**. The chatbot keeps track of the conversation context so that it can respond correctly to follow-up questions. This makes the interaction more natural and human-like.

Finally, the task includes **testing and improvement**. The chatbot is tested with different types of user inputs to check accuracy and performance. Based on user feedback, the system is improved by updating data, rules, or models.
Overall, the NLP Chatbot task focuses on building an intelligent system that can understand human language and respond effectively, providing a smooth and interactive user experience.
